# Project Overview

The backend is just a tiny JSON server for testing purposes/mocked API.

The frontend is a React + TypeScript demo application that consumes a mocked API to display, create, update, and delete items in a data table. The application features:

- DataTable with sorting, searching (apart from dates), and pagination
- CRUD operations with modals for adding and editing items
- State management using Zustand
- UI styling with Tailwind CSS
- Accessible modals using React Modal
- Responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile devices
- Most recent versions of the packages used

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate React frontend skills, state management, component design, and asynchronous data handling in a small, maintainable application.
