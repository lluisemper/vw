# Project Overview

The backend is just a tiny json server for testing purposes/mocked API.

The frontend is a React + TypeScript demo application that consumes a mocked API to display, create, update, and delete items in a data table. The application features:

- DataTable with sorting, searching, and pagination
- CRUD operations with modals for adding and editing items
- State management using Zustand
- UI styling with Tailwind CSS
- Accessible modals using React Modal
- Responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile devices

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate React frontend skills, state management, component design, and asynchronous data handling in a small, maintainable application.

#### TESTING NOTE

For testing styles I would prefer to use e2e testing or visual regression testing. That way representing a more real scenario, you want to see on the real world how it looks. Checking for classes on unit testing I do not think it is meaningful in most cases.

#### Optimization

Lazy load of the modal, only loaded when needed.
